      "subtitle": "Indo-Pacific Peace Forum provides a platform, where a group of organizations, institutions, stakeholders, and experts can exchange ideas and discuss issues, to promote peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific. The Indo-Pacific region is an expansive stretch from the eastern coast of Africa to the western shores of the Americas. The Indo-Pacific region is home to over 50% of the world's population and accounts for 60% of global GDP. The Indo-Pacific region faces complex security challenges, including territorial disputes, terrorism, cybersecurity threats, and great power rivalries. The Indo-Pacific is a critical hub for global trade and commerce, with many countries relying on sea routes for economic survival. The region's stability is crucial for global peace and prosperity. \n\n The Indo-Pacific region is home to diverse cultures, religions, and nations, making it an ideal testing ground for this philosophy. By embracing “The World is One Family Under God”, countries in the Indo-Pacific region can work together to build a more peaceful, prosperous, and harmonious community."
